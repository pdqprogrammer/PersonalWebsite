                <p>
                    Hi Everyone! I am Paul Quinones and you may be wondering who I am...Well let me tell you about myself! Followed up by some of the projects I have worked on.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I am a Game Developer interested in how games and technology can bring people together. I focus on creating game mechanics / systems that allow for sharing different experiences. As a Game Developer the goal is to create experiences that can bring people together. Part of this is making games that allow people to share experiences that may not be familiar. My goal is to help others share stories and find their own creative outlets to excel in.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    "Less But Better" is a quote that resonates with me. The idea of being able to bring fun to others with something is not expansive like an MMO but still polished. A game can have an impact without over-complicating mechanics. That is one of the driving factors behind the games I work on.<br/>

                        Featured projects are games with mechanics like platforming to FPS decorator to bear driving.

                        <h4>Published by Super Pose Press & Created by Plunder Inc</h4>
                        Hyper Bimbo Beats was built in Unity for mobile devices. My Role as Game Play Programmer / Architect was to create systems for managing the game to the beat of Music. This involved creating a Beat Management system that handled movement, animation, and audio for the game. Other systems involved using the Unity input system together with Game Events to trigger user dragging and releasing within the game. As the sole programmer the main focus was to build tools and structures for Designers, Artists, and Audio Engineers to leverage in putting the game together.<br/>

                        <h4>Published by Clothing Tech LLC</h4>
                        Garment Digital Twin is Fashion Design Software built for both Windows and Mac systems. My role as a Software Developer on this project was to work together with UI/UX Designers to build out core functionality. This involved building functionality in Unity to allow users to create garments and add on various features such as fabrics and buttons. Part of the work involved setting up Shaders through Shader Graph and building out code that would in realtime map out the different textures for fabrics on to a Garment. I also build out capabilities allowing users to import 3D files from cloud based systems into the application mapping out 3D data for visualization.

                        Al Dente is a 2D Platformer created using Unity for both Web and Windows. My role as programmer was to build out the core functionality of the different jumping platforms, game manager to handle different states, plugging in audio triggers, and creating tools to streamline design work. Part of the work done involved creating platform behaviors that allowed platforms to crumble and destroy or just rotate in place or even drop on a touch. Fields were exposed to allow the Audio Engineer to plug in sound effects created through FMOD.<br/>

                        <h4>Created by Paul Q - Solo Dev</h4>
                        Decor Hero was built for Windows PCs during the Global Game Jam making use of Unity. As the sole developer on this game I was responsible for building out core systems such as changing ammo, shooting paint onto walls plus furniture, and laying down flooring. This FPS features standard mechanics seen in typical FPS games such as shooting different types of ammo, jumping plus moving, and a HUD to inform the players on what design tools they are using to decorate this sandbox of a room.<br/>

                        <h4>Created by Paul Q - Solo Dev</h4>
                        Canceled Noise is a simple grid based game where players have to avoid getting caught in lit up squares long enough or it is game over. The game was built in Unity for Web making using of the Unity Input Manager. As the Sole programmer I was responsible for building out the basic game mechanics such as moving from square to square and changing between game states.<br/>

                <ul>
                    <li>Global Game Jams: Outside of work I have always been into Game Jams. Over the years I have taken part in over 10 Global Game Jam. It has been a great opportunity to work with others, learn, and make something in a 48 hour time frame. This has even lead to winning awards for local venues.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>YouTube Channel - <a href="http://paulprograms.games/" target="_blank">PaulPrograms</a>: I have an interest in learning new things and want to share my experiences with others. That is why I decided to start a YouTube channel focused on teaching Game Mechanics to others. The videos break down the mechanics and presents ways to execute them through design or code. PaulPrograms focuses on tools and content for use in learning Game Development.</li>
